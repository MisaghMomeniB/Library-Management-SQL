## 💡 Overview

This project is a **comprehensive SQL‑only library management system**, focused entirely on the database layer. It enables:

* CRUD operations on books, customers, employees, branches
* Tracking of book issuance and returns
* Analysis of data with advanced SQL queries
* Designed for academic/course usage or backend‑only integration into applications ([stackoverflow.com][1], [github.com][2], [sbozich.github.io][3])

---

## ✅ Features

* **Book Management**: Insert, update, delete records with fields such as title, category, availability, author, publisher, and rental price ([github.com][2])
* **Customer & Employee Management**: Track names, addresses, registration dates, salaries, positions, and branch assignments ([github.com][2])
* **Branch Management**: Store branch IDs, manager info, contact details ([github.com][2])
* **Issuance & Returns**: Track checkouts and check-ins with timestamps and availability flags ([github.com][4])
* **Analysis Queries**:

  * Available books by title/category/rental price
  * Employee listing by salary desc
  * Issued books with customer info
  * Aggregates: books per category, employees per branch
  * Filter: customers registered before given date with zero issues, books by category keywords ([github.com][2], [github.com][5])

## 🗄️ Database Schema & Structure

Prepare your SQL environment with key tables (names are illustrative):

| Table                  | Key Columns                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `books`                | id, title, category, author, publisher, price, available\_copies |
| `customers`            | id, name, address, registration\_date                            |
| `employees`            | id, name, position, salary, branch\_id                           |
| `branches`             | id, manager\_id, address, contact                                |
| `issuance`             | id, book\_id, customer\_id, issue\_date, return\_date            |
| `returns` *(optional)* | id, issuance\_id, return\_date, fines                            |

Use relational constraints with **foreign keys** for referential integrity and incorporate **indexes** on frequently queried columns like `category`, `registration_date`, `salary`, `branch_id`.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```

2. **Create a database**, e.g., `LibraryDB`.

3. **Import provided schema** (`schema.sql`) using your DB tool, e.g.:

   ```sql
   SOURCE schema.sql;
   ```

4. **Populate sample data** via `data.sql` (if included).

5. **Verify referential integrity**: Ensure primary keys and foreign keys are properly set.

## 🚀 Usage & SQL Queries

### Basic Operations

```sql
-- Insert new book
INSERT INTO books (title, category, author, publisher, price, available_copies)
VALUES ('Book Title','History','Jane Doe','Acme Pub', 12.99, 3);

-- Issue book (example procedure)
INSERT INTO issuance (book_id, customer_id, issue_date)
VALUES (1, 5, CURRENT_DATE);

-- Return book
UPDATE issuance
SET return_date = CURRENT_DATE
WHERE id = 123;
```

### Sample Analytical Queries

* **List available books**:

  ```sql
  SELECT title, category, price
  FROM books
  WHERE available_copies > 0;
  ```

* **Top earning employees**:

  ```sql
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  ORDER BY salary DESC;
  ```

* **Book issue counts per category**:

  ```sql
  SELECT b.category, COUNT(*) AS issues
  FROM issuance AS i
  JOIN books AS b ON i.book_id = b.id
  GROUP BY b.category;
  ```

## 📊 Data Analysis & Reporting

Key insights you can derive:

* 📚 **Books available by category/title/price**
* 👥 **Active employees per branch**
* 📅 **Customer activity by signup date and issue history**
* 📖 **Issued books and associated customer info**

Use these to build dashboards, CSV exports, or raw data sources for your app layers.

---

## 🧹 Best Practices & Tips

* Use **transactions** to lock rows during multi-step operations (e.g. issuance)
* Implement **triggers/stored procedures** to:

  * Update `available_copies` automatically
  * Compute fines on `return_date` past due
  * Log history
* Apply **indexes** on columns used in `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` (e.g. `category`, `issue_date`) for performance
* Maintain **normalized schema**, and use views for reports
